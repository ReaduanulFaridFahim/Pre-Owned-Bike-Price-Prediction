# Pre-Owned-Bike-Price-Prediction

🏍️ AI-Powered Pricing for Used Motorcycles

Developed a machine learning-based system to accurately predict the market value of pre-owned motorcycles. This project helps buyers and sellers make informed pricing decisions based on key factors such as brand, model, year, mileage, condition, and location.

Project Overview:
Pricing used bikes is challenging due to multiple influencing factors. This system applies data-driven predictions to enhance transparency and accuracy. After evaluating multiple models, Gradient Boosting and Random Forest delivered the best accuracy.

Key Features:
✔️ User-Friendly Web Interface – Modern and responsive design
✔️ Data-Driven Price Estimation – ML models trained on real-world data
✔️ Dynamic Input Form – Fetches bike brands & models from Google
✔️ Custom Alert System – Animated notifications for predictions
✔️ Advanced Data Processing – Handles missing values, outliers, and scaling
✔️ Model Comparison – Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting
✔️ Optimized Performance – Hyperparameter tuning for accuracy

Results (Top Models):
📌 Gradient Boosting & Random Forest – Highest Accuracy 🎯

Tech Stack:
🔹 Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn)
🔹 Web Technologies – HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Flask

Future Enhancements:
🔹 Expanding Dataset for better predictions
🔹 Deep Learning Integration for improved accuracy
🔹 Price Trend Analysis for depreciation insights

This project bridges machine learning and e-commerce, making used bike pricing more accurate and reliable.
